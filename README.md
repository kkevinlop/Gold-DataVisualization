# Gold-DataVisualization

This project is based on History Gold data, which is derived from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faisaljanjua0555/daily-gold-price-historical-dataset 

It reports on the study to develop a model to predict the price of gold, based on the date, volume, and the open and close price of gold between the year 2000-2022. Generally, investors will put their money into gold because gold plays an important role as a stabilizing influence for investment portfolios. In this study, we will compare four regression methods, which are the Linear Model Regression, Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, and the Ridge Regression using R language data mining process. According to this study's experimental result, we concluded that the best regression method among the four regression methods used is the Lasso Regression Method. This paper can be further developed and simulated for the comparison of the globalâ€™s monetary crisis. Future works can be pursued to identify the fluctuation rate of gold mining, stocks market returns, and inflationary.

The explanation and analysis are together with the code.
